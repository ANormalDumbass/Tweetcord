## ‚ö°Usage

**üì¢This tutorial is suitable for version 0.3.2 or later. (Recommended: 0.3.4 or later)**

Because the database structure has been updated, you must use the following code to update the database structure.

```py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
import sqlite3

load_dotenv()

conn = sqlite3.connect(f"{os.getenv('DATA_PATH')}tracked_accounts.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute('ALTER TABLE notification ADD enabled INTEGER DEFAULT 1')

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

</details>

### 1. Create and configure the .env file

```env
BOT_TOKEN=YourDiscordBotToken
TWITTER_TOKEN=YourTwitterAccountAuthToken
DATA_PATH=./data/
```

You can retrieve your auth token from cookies, or you can explore other methods to obtain it.

### 2. Configure the configs.yml file

All time-related configurations are measured in seconds.

```yml
prefix: ''                          # The prefix for bot commands.
activity_name: ''                   # The activity name displayed by the bot.
tweets_check_period: 10             # The check frequency for the posts (it is not recommended to set this value too low to avoid rate limiting).
tweets_updater_retry_delay: 300     # Retry Interval when Tweets Updater encounters exceptions (e.g., rate limitations).
tasks_monitor_check_period: 60      # Interval at which to check if each tasks is functioning properly, and if a task has stopped, attempt a restart.
tasks_monitor_log_period: 14400     # Interval at which to output the list of currently running tasks to the execution log.
```

### 3. Run and invite the bot to your server

```shell
python bot.py
```

In certain operating systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`.
