## Installation

Before running the bot, you need to install the necessary modules.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In certain operating systems, you may need to use the command `pip3` instead of `pip` for installation.

## Usage

**üì¢This tutorial is suitable for version 0.3.2 or higher.**

### 1. Create and configure the .env file

```env
BOT_TOKEN=YourDiscordBotToken
TWITTER_TOKEN=YourTwitterAccountAuthToken
DATA_PATH=./data/
```

You can retrieve your auth token from cookies, or you can explore other methods to obtain it.

### 2. Configure the configs.yml file

All time-related configurations are measured in seconds.

```yml
prefix: ''                          # The prefix for bot commands.
activity_name: ''                   # The activity name displayed by the bot.
tweets_check_period: 10             # The check frequency for the posts (it is not recommended to set this value too low to avoid rate limiting).
tweets_updater_retry_delay: 300     # Retry Interval when Tweets Updater encounters exceptions (e.g., rate limitations).
tasks_monitor_check_period: 60      # Interval at which to check if each tasks is functioning properly, and if a task has stopped, attempt a restart.
tasks_monitor_log_period: 14400     # Interval at which to output the list of currently running tasks to the execution log.
```

### 3. Run the bot

```shell
python bot.py
```

In certain operating systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

### 4. Have fun

Now you can go back to Discord and use the `/add notifier` command to set up notifications for the Twitter users you wish to receive updates from!
