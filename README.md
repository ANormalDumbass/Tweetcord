# Tweetcord

Tweetcord is a discord bot that uses the tweety module to let you receive tweet updates from specific Twitter users on discord. You just need to set up the Twitter users and discord channels you want to follow, and Tweetcord will automatically send the tweets to the designated channels, so you won’t miss any important news.🐦
